README
------
This repository contains sample code implementing the Long Short-term Graphical model presented in the paper

Anand Ramachendran, Steven S. Lumetta, Eric Klee, Deming Chen, "A recurrent Markov state-space generative model for sequences", AISTATS 2019

The following directories are included
* networks: Contains the base model and associated code (lsgm.py, motif_finder.py, bidirectional_lsgm.py).
* misc: Contains additional code to support training.
* applications: Contains code to run model training/evaluation.

The implementation uses pytorch
